Integration with Your System
Connect this voice cloner with your video setup:

# Record your voice or use existing sample
voice_path = voice_cloner.record_voice_sample(10, "narrator_voice.wav")

# Create reusable voice profile
voice_cloner.create_voice_profile(voice_path, "professional_narrator")

# Generate narration for each room with timestamps
room_audio = voice_cloner.process_audio_for_tour(tour_script, "professional_narrator", segment=True)

# Each audio segment can be synchronized with your room footage
